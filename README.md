# UniquePresidentialLastnameGetter
Simple tool to get all unique presidential last names to aid students in my class in the implementation of a lab.

This tool uses selenium and its chromedriver to automate the process of returning a set containing the last name of each president that is unique. This set comes out to 40 individual last names as their have been ancestoral presidents (e.x. Bush Senior, W Bush).  This is to aid students with the Lesson 09 lab.  It is not the answer to the lab but just an aid to not have to manually copy paste each presidents last name from the given website.  The chromedriver.exe is in this repo so it should work by running the main.py file if you have all three files in the same directory (main.py, requirements.txt, chromedriver.exe).

I hope this helps someone!
